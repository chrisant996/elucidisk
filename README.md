# Elucidisk

This uses a sunburst chart to visualize disk space usage on Windows.

It is modelled after [Scanner](http://www.steffengerlach.de/freeware/), 
[Diskitude](https://madebyevan.com/diskitude/), and other similar disk space 
viewers.

The name "Elucidisk" is a portmanteau of "elucidate" and "disk".

## What can it do?

- Scans drives or folders to find the size used.
- Shows the results in a sunburst chart.
- The chart has several configurable options:
    - Use plain colors.
    - Use rainbow colors (based on angle in the sunburst).
    - Use heatmap colors (based on size).
    - Show/hide names of files and directories in the sunburst (if the name fits).
    - Show/hide free space for drives.
    - Use the actual compressed size for compressed files, instead of the uncompressed size.
    - Show arcs with proportional area (e.g. two arcs for 50 GB directories will have the same area, even if they are at different distances from the center).
    - Show size comparison bar when hovering over an arc (the comparison bars are always in the center ring, so their sizes are comparable even when Proportional Area is turned off).
- Show combined summary chart for all local drives.
- Right click on an arc for a context menu of available actions.
- Right click elsewhere for a context menu of configurable options (or press <kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>F10</kbd> or <kbd>Apps</kbd> key).

## Why was it created?

When viewing a sunburst chart of disk space usage, I want the free space on a 
disk to show up in the chart.  The only sunburst disk space visualizer I could 
find that includes the free space is Scanner.

I also wanted a few improvements to the user interface, such as highlighting 
the arc under the mouse pointer and showing names of directories/files when
the name fits in the arc.

I wanted to use the MIT license.  Most disk space visualizers are either
proprietary or use a "viral" version of GPL license.

So, I wrote my own.

It is written in C++ and uses DirectX for rendering.
